## Trends
- Districtwide, students a more successful in reading than in math, regardless of the school's size or per-student spending.  However, this gap in success is significantly larger in the lowest-performing schools. In these schools, the difference in pass rate from math to reading averages about 14%. For the top 5 performing schools, this gap averages only about 3%.
- When comparing academic performance to school spending, we see a negative correlation. In other words, an increase in school spending appears to cause a drop in student success.  
- Similarly, the data shows an increase in campus size also causes a drop in student success. This may be a result of lower student-to-teacher ratios on smaller campuses. However, we do not have the data to support this claim. 

Given the trends above, it's no surprise that Charter Schools consistently out preform District schools in academics. Of the 15 schools we looked at, Charter Schools had the smallest student populations and smallest per-student spending.
