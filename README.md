* Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading.)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

As final considerations:

* Use the pandas library and Jupyter Notebook.
* You must submit a link to your Github/Git Lab repo that contains your Jupyter Notebook.
* You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.
* See [Example Solution](PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb) for a reference on the expected format.
